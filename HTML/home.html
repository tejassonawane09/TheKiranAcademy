            I am writing to formally resign from my <i><b>position</b></i> as a Data Entry Clerk at Cloud Data 360, effective immediately. After joining the company recently, I have come to realize that this role is not the right fit for me, and it is in the best interest of both myself and the company to step down at this time.

            I deeply <u>regret any inconvenience caused by my <b>decision</b> and sincerely apologize for the short notice.</u>   I am truly grateful for the opportunity to be a part of Cloud Data 360, even for a brief period.
        </p>
